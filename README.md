# Linear-Model-Selection-and-Regularization
Identify reasons to perform predictor selection and issues with collinear predictors.
Understand situations in which penalized regression is better option for regression.
State basic form of penalized regression model.
State basic form of constrained regression model.
State the constrained formulations for the Ridge Regression (RR), LASSO, and Elastic Net model fit goal functions.
Understand basic behavior of penalized regression as shrinking coefficients toward origin.
Visualize constraints as restrictions in the coefficient space.
Understand pathway model fit of penalized regression.
Explain Elastic Net as a “compromise” between RR and LASSO.
Compare and contrast penalized regression methods.
Fit penalized regression models using glmnet function in R.
Understand need for validation methods.
Apply cross-validation to penalized regression models using cv.glmnet function in R, for the purpose of model selection.
Apply bootstrapping to estimate error of coefficients.
